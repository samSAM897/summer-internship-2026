            HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard language for Web
            pages. Using HTML, we can provide the basic stucture of the website.
            It consists of a series of elements. HTML elements tell the browser
            how to display the content.
          </p>

          <p>This is how to create a simple website in HsTML:</p>
          <img src="./img/easy-webpage.png" alt="A simple HTML Code" />
          <p>This simple code snippet results in a webpage like this:</p>
          <img
            src="./img/easy-webpage-output.png"
            alt="Output of the simple HTML Code"
          />
          <p>
            HTML has many commonly used tags, which are used by almost all the
            web developers around the world:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <code>head</code>: This tag is used to provide the metadata and
              all other information which is not visible to the end-user but is
              accesible by the browser.
            </li>

            <li>
              <code>body</code>: The body tag contains all the visible
              information which the end-user interacts with. It can contain
              images, audio, video, forms, etc.
            </li>

            <li>
              <code>div</code>: One of the most commonly used tags, the div tag
              is used to divide a page into smaller divisions which can be
              further divided into much smaller sub divisions.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If you wish to work with HTML, you should always remember to use the
            following boilerplate code:
          </p>
          <img
            src="./img/boilerplate-code.png"
            alt="A sample boilerplate code to help you get started with HTML"
          />

          <p>
            CSS or Cascading Style Sheets is the primary language used to style
            HTML documents. CSS describes how HTML elements should be displayed.
            CSS can also control the layout of multiple webpages all at once.
            Styling is done via the use of Selectors. Some common selectors are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Simple selectors: Select the elements based on the tag name.
            </li>
            <li>
              Combinator Selectors: Combining two or more elements together
              based on a specific relationship between them.
            </li>
            <li>
              Pseudo Class Selectors: Select elements based on a certain state.
            </li>
            <li>
              Pseudo Element Selector: Select and style the parts of an element.
            </li>
            <li>
              Attribute Selector: Select element based on an attribute or
              attribute value.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>A rule in CSS consists of a selector and a block:</p>
          <img src="./img/simple-css.png" alt="A standard block of CSS code" />
        </article>
      </section>

      <section id="CSS-select">
        <header>CSS Selectors</header>
        <p>CSS has many different ways of selecting elements:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p class="title">The element Selector:</p>
            <img
              src="./img/para-selector.png"
              alt="An example of the element selector in CSS"
            />
            <p>
              This will give all the paragraph elements a red color and make the
              font to be 18 pixels.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p class="title">The id Selector:</p>
            <img
              src="./img/id-selector-example.png"
              alt="An example of the id selector in CSS"
            />
            <p>
              This gives the element with the id "test-id" a display of grid and
              aligns its contents to center.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p class="title">The class Selector:</p>
            <img
              src="./img/class-selector.png"
              alt="An example of the class selector in CSS"
            />
            <p>
              This gives the elements with the class "test" a brown color with a
              beige background.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p class="title">The Universal Selector:</p>
            <img
              src="./img/uni-sel.png"
              alt="An example of the Universal selector in CSS"
            />
            <p>
              This will give all the content in the webpage a color of green.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p class="title">The Grouping Selector:</p>
            <img
              src="./img/group-selector.png"
              alt="An example of the grouping selector in CSS"
            />
            <p>
              This will give all paragraphs, lists and anchor tags a font-size
              of 22 pixels and a font-family of Veradna.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
