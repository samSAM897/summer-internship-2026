# Git and basics of VCS

A VCS or Version Control System is a way of managing, keeping track of a large codebase or a collection of files allowing multiple developers, managers and other people to work on the same project.

### Centralized Version Control System

Earlier in the older legacy systems, a centralized VCS was used, in which the developers all had to work on a single shared repository, which even caused a lot of issues as there were no chances of parallel development.

Some common examples are:

- Subversion
- Perforce

### Distributed Version Control System

In the past few years, developers and project managers have moved to a more de-centralized or distributed version control system. These systems do not rely solely on a centralized server to store all the project files. Instead, every developer now has a complete clone of the project files and has the history of almost all the changes and commits made during the development of the project on their local machines.

## Getting Started with Git:

To get started with git, firstly install git from:
[git-scm](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

After installing git, let us start by cross-checking if git is installed.

To check if git is installed run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git --version
```

Now if you have git installed, let's go over some basic git commands:

1. init: The git init command is used to initialise a git repository in the present directory.

   ```bash
   git init
   ```

   This will create a git repository in your current directory.

2. add: The add command is used to add the changes made in the code and move it to the staging/tracking area of git. If you do not use add command, the changes you have made will be untracked.

   ```bash
    git add -A
    # or specify file name
    git add <filename>
   ```

   The add command has multiple ways of adding a file. You can use the "-A" to add all the files that have changes or you can specify a single file you wish to.

3. commit: The git commit command is used to create a timestamp of our original codebase, this timestamp is useful for keeping track of the progress of the application and also reverting back incase of any errors.

   ```bash
   # To make a commit.
   git commit -m "a meaningful commit message"
   ```

   The HEAD will now point to the commit_id generated by this command.

4. push: The git push command is used to move the changes to the remote/central repository.
   ```bash
   git push <remote-repo-alias> <branchname>
   ```
